# parallel sand/substances simulator
Implementation of a material simulator in C, user can add material and see how they interact over time.

## Dependencies
* GCC
* GNU Make
* SDL2
* CUDA
* MPI
* OPENMP
* must be on linux for the <sys/time.h>, SDL and TTF typography 
* 
## Demo
Graphical interface of the simulation

There are 6 elements with unique properties, these elements can be toggles and placed with the mouse.

## Sequential version

Sequential version is based on a found SDL implementation of a cellular automata https://github.com/joaquin-rossi/automata; Then the implemented logic for the sandsimulation, the element rules, rendering and parallelism from scratch

run the makefile to compile

# OpenMp parallel version

optimized parallel version with OpenMp.

# Cuda paralell version

Functional Cuda paraller version, result are slower for this application

# MPI paralell version

OpenMPI paraller version of the logic, console simplified app that calculate the matrices but does not display, implementation was done in a 8 computers Aws cluster

to run: after all the configuration it is compiled and run with 8 nodes

mpicc sandsim.c -o sandsim
mpirun -np 8 -host nodo0,nodo1,nodo2,nodo3,nodo4,nodo5,nodo6,nodo7 ./sandsim

## Extra info

* Press spacebar to toggle between paused and unpaused.
* Press the mouse to draw with the elements
* Press the keys to change the elemnts.
F= fire, R= rock, A= air, W= water, S= sand, H= smoke/humo...
